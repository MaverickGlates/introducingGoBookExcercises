//In Chapter 2, we learned about GO's basic types. In this chapter, we will look at three more built-in types: arrays, slices, and maps

//ARRAYS
//An Array is a numbered sequence of elements of a single type with a fixed lenght. in GO they look like this:

var x [5]int

func main() {
	fmt.Println()
}
